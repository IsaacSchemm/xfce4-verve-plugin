xfce4-verve-plugin-smartbookmark
================================

A panel plugin for xfce4, forked from xfce4-verve-plugin.
This plugin is still named "xfce4-verve-plugin" internally, so they can't both be installed!

Additional features
-------------------

* Maximum panel width is now 300 instead of 100
* Entries starting with ! and/or \ can be directed to DuckDuckGo (ddg.gg)
* The plugin can be configured to launch a "smart bookmark" instead of trying to run a local command
* You can now add a label to the left side of the plugin
